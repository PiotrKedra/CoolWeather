# FlexWeather

My first app published in google play, build with react-native. 

It can be downloaded for free here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=piotrkedra.flexweather&hl=en_US&gl=US

## Description

Weather forecast for next 7 days. Hour by hour forecast is available for next 48 hours.

The weather forecast app automatically detects the weather at your location. It presents date on lovely charts: temperature, wind and rainfall. It also contains data about wind speed, wind direction, pressure, humidity, clouds cover, visibility, uv index, dew point, sunrise and sunset.

App also change its theme based on the current weather condition so it is more easy to read.

## How is it going?

I've build this app to learn react-native. At first I've planed to keep updating it because I realy liked final outcome, but then I found out that using free weather providers apis (and free localization places apis) it is not possible to maintain a proper user expirience. Therefore, I decided to stop working on that project, because I didn't wanted to spend my money on it.

However, if someone wants to keep working on it for any reason, feel free to contact me.
